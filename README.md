### A gardening tool for house plants dummies.

This project was developed as a final project of my Higher Technical Certificate in development of multi-platform applications. Aimed to be a user-friendly gadget
to help non-experts in plant care. The objective of the project was to put my learning on android and REST architecture into practice. 
Basically the interesting thing of the whole project is the idea of keeping the three main components (the board with the sensors, the android app, and the database)
independent of each other.

# Hardware

The main component of the device is the nodeMCU v3 with a ESP8266 microchip for the WiFi connection.

For measuring ambient temperature and humidity the main board uses the DHT22.

Next we have the capacitive soil moisture sensor v2.0
